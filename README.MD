# c64js
This is an embryo of a commodore 64 emulator, written from scratch in pure javascript. A demo of the emulator is available at [www.c64js.com](http://www.c64js.com).

## Roms
In order to run roms, drop them in `.prg`-format on the emulators canvas area. The VIC-II (GPU) chip isn't fully emulated yet, so there is a limited number of ROMS which actually will work.
